# Information about collected user data

This extension does NOT collect any data of its users, all required data (which tokens are added, secrets, etc...) will only be stored in either the ```chrome.storage.sync``` or ````chrome.storage.local``` stores of the user. No data is being transmitted to any third-party.
If you want to prove this claim, have a look in the source code in this repo.
